### About TCG ONE

[TCG ONE](https://tcgone.net) is an Online Automated Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Simulator where players can gather online and play with their favorite cards in their respective formats. Its software is completely fan-made and is in no way affiliated with TPCI or its official game. 

Some of its features are: Automated Game Mechanics, Online 1-1 play, Deck Editor, Lobby & Chat, Real Card Images, Multiple Game Formats (including Standard, Expanded and Classic Old School formats), Spectation, Game scoring system and Scoreboards, Career and Quickplay game modes, Personal Inventory, Assemble/Dissolve cards with ink, Leveling, Booster Pack simulator, Daily Quests and Achievements.

It went live on 18 July 2013 and is being actively developed and maintained. [more info](https://tcgone.net/about)

### Preliminaries

- We are using Groovy language to implement cards and their effects, with a custom designed DSL for it. It is basically a superset of Java, if you know Java than you'll easily get used to it.
- Open sourcing the entire project is a really big task due to its complexity. For now, you will only be able to test your changes remotely (not on your local machine). I plan to restructure and open source the entire game engine gradually.
- After every push to `master` branch, our CI system will automatically rebuild the code and update the commit status with the log. If everything goes well, it will deploy to <https://dev.tcgone.net>, our staging dev server, which can be used to test cards before going to production. It is a special UI that allows searching and adding any card directly into play. Try it now!
- If the build fails, you can check the logs via the status icon near every commit, first click the icon then click 'details'. A 'successful' build does not mean the code works, due to the dynamic nature of Groovy. Therefore, please test ALL cards by invoking ALL of their effects on [the dev server](https://dev.tcgone.net).
- [The production server](https://play.tcgone.net) is rolled out manually, therefore your changes will not be immediately visible in production.
